Context
More than 25% of adults in North America eat at fast-food restaurants every day. Many foods from these establishments are fried, which alters the composition of the food. During the frying process, foods lose water and absorb fats—which are often oxidized or hydrogenated by high heat. Frying also increases the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and acrylamide, which contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation when consumed.
